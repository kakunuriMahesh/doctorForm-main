        "rTMS (repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) treatment is highly beneficial for managing OCD. It involves non-invasive brain stimulation to alleviate symptoms. Additionally, receiving excellent counseling from a psychologist, such as Mr. Srinivas, and effective prescriptions from Dr. Suhasini Mam can significantly enhance the overall treatment experience and outcomes for individuals with OCD.",
